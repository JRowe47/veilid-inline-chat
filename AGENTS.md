# Agent Guidelines

This repository aims to produce a single‑file Veilid chat app using **vanilla JavaScript**.

* Use **ES modules** and keep the code free of third‑party bundlers.
* Prefer **2‑space indentation** and Unix line endings.
* Run `npm run build` after making changes to ensure the single‑file build still succeeds.
* Do not commit generated artifacts (`dist/` and `src/wasm-embedded.js`).
* Keep the project structure aligned with the milestones in `TIMELINE.md`.
